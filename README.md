# sapere-perquiro

This repository functions as a personal sandbox for the exploration and experimentation of various projects aimed at 
acquiring new skills and developing practical solutions. While it offers valuable opportunities for learning and 
experimentation, it should not be regarded as a comprehensive source of authoritative knowledge or guidance. The content 
within this repository primarily serves to document my learning experiences and to provide insight into my ongoing projects.

## Projects

1. **Smart-Home**: 
This project was developed as part of my Software Development training course (Switch). It is not 
intended to replicate a full-fledged smart home system. Many features are not implemented, as the project adhered 
strictly to the defined user stories and did not extend beyond them.

2. **CEXscraper**: 
This project represents a personal aspiration that predates my coding journey. It is designed as a 
specialized application and may be challenging to replicate, as it relies on an Excel file with specific entries that 
I am unable to share.
