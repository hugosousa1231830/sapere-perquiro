# sapere-perquiro

This repository functions as a personal sandbox for the exploration and experimentation of various projects aimed at 
acquiring new skills and developing practical solutions. While it offers valuable opportunities for learning and 
experimentation, it should not be regarded as a comprehensive source of authoritative knowledge or guidance. The content 
within this repository primarily serves to document my learning experiences and to provide insight into my ongoing projects.

## Projects

1. **Smart-Home**: 
This project was developed as part of my Software Development training course (Switch). It is not 
intended to replicate a full-fledged smart home system. Many features are not implemented, as the project adhered 
strictly to the defined user stories and did not extend beyond them. It is a great source of a lot of things, including 4
clean architecture, DDD, GRASP/SOLID principles, devops, databases, testing, design and analysis of requirements, and much
more. The project was created by a group of 10 students, and I have received their permission to use it as part of my
portfolio. 

2. **CEXscraper**: 
This project represents a personal aspiration that predates my coding journey. Upon receiving the minimum viable knowledge
required to implement it, I decided to pursue this project as a means of consolidating my learning and gaining practical
experience. The project follows the process of obtaining information from an excel file, utilizing Selenium to scrape data
from the CEX website, and storing relevant data in a new excel file. The project explores concepts such as web scraping,
webdrivers, use of Selenium, a pinch of asynchronous programming and it is so different from a normal project that it was
also a challenge to implement a reasonable architecture.

3. **kafka_eda**:
This project is a simple implementation of an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) using Apache Kafka. It is 
intended to demonstrate the basic concepts of EDA and Kafka, and to provide a starting point for further exploration. 
The readme file contains a theoretical overview of EDA and Kafka, setting up kafka in a docker container, and using
springboot to aid on the implementation of kafka producers and consumers.

4. **GraphQl**:
This project aimed to explore the GraphQl technology and its implementation in Java. There is a theoretical part and a 
practical part where I implemented a simple GraphQl server and used GraphiQL to test it.

5. **Databases** 
I decided to create a project to deepen my understanding of various databases and how to interact with them using Java, 
despite my minimal experience with SQL databases and Spring Data JPA. Although combining multiple databases could lead to 
a chaotic system, I see it as an exciting challenge to integrate them into a single application with a unified entry point. 
This project explores relational (RDBMS), NoSQL, and in-memory databases, demonstrating their integration with a Java 
application using Spring Boot. It has taken far longer than anticipated, revealing complexities I had not fully anticipated. 
Despite numerous headaches and ongoing hurdles, Iâ€™m persevering through the challenges. Details can be found in the specific 
README file, but the project is still a work in progress.
